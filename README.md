# Keras-Deep-Learning

## Keras Overview 
   Keras is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of Tensorflow, Theano, and CNTK. It enables fast  experimentation through a high level, user-friendly, modular and extensible API. Keras can also be run on both CPU and GPU.

## Keras task

1. Prepare a Python code using Keras to solve the toy problem.

2. Run the model for different numbers of Epochs: 150,500,1500

3. Plot graphs of accuracy and loss versus epoch number for these three cases.

4. Create an interesting visualization showing how well your model performed by plotting predictions versus observed targets.

## Project2KT


1. An evaluation of the NNs accuracy; how well does it predict the observed targets based on the features as inputs.

2. Showing Graphs demonstrating how the loss decreases and the accuracy increases with each iteration (epoch). 

3. Applying three different learning rates to show how convergence depends on learning rate with this algorithm.

4. Describe what a confusion matrix for each graph.

5. compare how binary cross-entropy compares with just using mean squared error.
